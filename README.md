## 🧠 How It Works

1. User logs in via Clerk and selects an interview to start.
2. The app displays one question at a time.
3. The user clicks "Record Answer" → Webcam & Mic start → Timer starts (90s).
4. When recording stops or time ends:
   - Voice input is transcribed
   - Feedback is generated via LLM (`generateContent`)
   - Result is saved to PostgreSQL
5. Once all questions are answered, user is shown a feedback summary.

## 🔐 Interview Integrity

- 👁️ **Tab Switch Detection:** If user switches tabs, the interview ends instantly.
- 🚫 **No Manual Question Skipping:** Only move forward after submitting an answer.
